# Blog-Style Learning Notes

## HTTP Basics
- HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web.
- It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and information on the internet.
- HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## REST Fundamentals
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
- It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations.

## Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
- Common authentication methods include Basic Auth, OAuth, JWT, etc.
- Secure authentication is crucial for protecting sensitive data.

## API Testing
- API testing involves testing APIs directly to ensure they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.
- Tools for API testing include Postman, Swagger, and automated testing frameworks.
- Proper API testing helps identify issues early in the development process.

## Generating Tasks for Coding Plans

### Introduction

In this section, we will explain how to generate tasks for coding plans. This will help you break down your project into manageable steps and ensure that you stay on track.

### Example Task and Plan

#### Task

Title: Implement User Authentication
Description: Implement user authentication using JWT in the Node.js API.

#### Plan

1. `src/middlewares/auth.ts` (ADD)
   - Create a new file for authentication middleware
   - Implement a function to verify JWT tokens

2. `src/controllers/authController.ts` (ADD)
   - Create a new file for authentication controller
   - Implement functions for user registration and login

3. `src/routes/authRoutes.ts` (ADD)
   - Create a new file for authentication routes
   - Define routes for user registration and login

4. `src/models/User.ts` (CHANGE)
   - Add fields for storing hashed passwords
   - Implement a method to compare passwords

5. `src/services/authService.ts` (ADD)
   - Create a new file for authentication service
   - Implement functions for hashing passwords and generating JWT tokens

6. `src/app.ts` (CHANGE)
   - Add the authentication routes to the main application

By following this plan, you can implement user authentication in a structured and organized manner.
